# Regular Expression to NFA Converter

This repository hosts a web application that converts a regular expression (RegExp) into a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). It offers classes for states, transitions, and inputs, along with functions for operations like union, concatenation, and closure. The app provides both the transition table and a visual diagram of the resulting NFA. The project is built using Dart and Flutter, focusing on delivering a smooth and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Convert RegExp to NFA**: Input a regular expression to get an NFA representation.
- **Transition Table**: View the transition table generated for the NFA.
- **Visual Diagram**: Get a visual diagram of the NFA for better understanding.
- **Web Application**: Accessible online, no installation required.
